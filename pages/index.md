Kurrawong AI is a small, Artificial Intelligence, company in Australia specialising in [Knowledge Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph). 

We use KGs for data storage, as a transfer format, when serialised, and as inputs to advanced reasoning and data processing tasks, such as [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

We model data using the [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) so it's in the richest, most open and most extensibe form data can be.

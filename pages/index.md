# Kurrawong AI

Kurrawong AI is a small Artificial Intelligence company based in Australia specialising in the use of [Knowledge Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph). We use KGs to model data for data transfer, data storage and as inputs to advanced reasoning and data processing tasks, such as [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

There's not much more to say yet. No, Kurrawong AI's not secretive, it's just not fully up-and-running yet!

Until Kurrawong AI is all up, just contact Nicholas, the principal, on <info@kurrawong.net> for any information.

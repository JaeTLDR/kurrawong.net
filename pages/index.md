# Kurrawong AI

This is soon to be the new homepage of Kurrawong AI.

Kurrawong AI is a small, Australian, Artificial Intelligency company specialising in the use of [Knowledge Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_graph) as the basis of tasks such as [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) various advanced forms of reasoning.

There's not much more to say yet. No, Kurrawong AI's not secretive, it's just not fully up-and-running yet!

Until Kurrawong AI is up, just contact the principal, Nicholas, on <info@kurrawong.net> for anything.
